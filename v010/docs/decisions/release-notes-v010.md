# SimpleState v0.1.0 Release Notes

## Major Improvements

### 1. Performance Optimization through Batched Updates

The framework now includes a sophisticated batching system for state updates:

#### Batch Manager Implementation
- **New Module**: `batchManager.js`
  - Efficient Map-based queue system for state updates
  - Uses requestAnimationFrame for optimal rendering performance
  - Automatic queue flushing aligned with browser paint cycles
  - Memory-safe cleanup mechanisms

#### API Enhancements
- New `immediate` flag in setState options for time-critical updates
- Batch operations are transparent to existing code
- Clean API with queue, flushTarget, and clear operations

### 2. Native Web Features Integration

Major architectural shift towards leveraging native browser capabilities:

#### CSS Custom Properties as State
- Simplified state management using CSS variables
- Native browser optimization for updates
- Built-in string serialization handling
- Reduced framework overhead

#### Shadow DOM Integration
- Natural component boundaries through Shadow DOM
- Automatic style encapsulation
- Efficient scoping of selectors
- Clear parent-child relationships

#### CSS Cascade for State Inheritance
- Leveraging native CSS inheritance
- Removed manual DOM traversal logic
- More predictable state propagation
- Browser-optimized performance

### 3. Code Simplification

Significant reduction in complexity while maintaining functionality:

#### setState.js Changes
- Removed manual cross-shadow handling
- Eliminated explicit root write controls
- Simplified property setting logic
- Added batching support

#### getState.js Improvements
- Removed manual DOM traversal
- Simplified inheritance handling
- Reduced code complexity
- Better error handling

## Breaking Changes
- Removed `crossShadow` option (now handled natively)
- Removed `allowRoot` option (using native CSS cascade)
- Modified inheritance behavior to follow CSS rules

## Migration Guide

### Updating from v0.0.9
1. Remove any explicit `crossShadow` configurations
2. Update component styles to use CSS containment where needed
3. Replace manual inheritance control with CSS cascade

### Best Practices
- Use Shadow DOM for natural state boundaries
- Leverage CSS cascade for state inheritance
- Consider batching for performance-critical updates
- Use `immediate` flag only when necessary

## Performance Impact
- Reduced style recalculations through batching
- Better memory usage with efficient queuing
- Improved shadow DOM boundary handling
- Native CSS optimization benefits

## Future Considerations
- Enhanced debugging tools
- State change history tracking
- Selective state inheritance controls
- Performance monitoring utilities
